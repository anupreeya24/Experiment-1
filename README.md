# Experiment - 1
**Aim:**<br>
a. To display 'Hello World'.<br>
b. To display the sum of two numbers.<br>
c. To display the average of two numbers.<br>
d. To determine whether a number is an odd or an even number.<br>
e. To determine whether a year is a leap year or not.<br>
<br>
**Theory:**<br>
C++ is programming language that is procedural, object-oriented, and generic in nature. The language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ is an extension of C, adding classes and objects to enhance its capabilities. At its core, C++ programs consist of functions, variables, and control structures.<br>
C++ introduces the concept of classes, which encapsulate data and functions which brings about object-oriented programming. Objects are instances of classes, allowing data abstraction and inheritance. Operator overloading and templates enhance functionality, enabling code flexibility.<br>
Standard libraries in C++ are crucial because they contain needed functions and data structures, which include vectors, lists and strings. These comprise bold container classes and algorithms in Standard Template Library (STL). There is a solid error management provided by exception handling.<br>
# Algorithm :
Start
Input: Read two numbers, a and b.
Process:
Calculate sum = a + b
Calculate difference = a - b
Calculate product = a * b
If b != 0, calculate division = a / b
Else, set division = "undefined"
Output: Display sum, difference, product, and division.
End 

Start
Include Necessary Libraries:
Include the iostream library for input and output operations.
Define Main Function:
Start the main function.
Output Message:
Use cout to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
End Main Function:
Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
End

Start
Declare Variables:
Create integer variables num1, num2, and average.
Input First Number:
Prompt the user to enter the first number.
Read the input and store it in num1.
Input Second Number:
Prompt the user to enter the second number.
Read the input and store it in num2.
Calculate Average:
Calculate the average using the formula:
average
=
(
num1
+
num2
)
2.0
average= 
2.0
(num1+num2)
â€‹
 
Output Average:
Display the average to the user in the format: "The average of num1 and num2 is average."
End
